       <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>Minecraft is a game where you build things with blocks in an open and free-to-explore virtual world. It's what gamers call a 'sandbox,' because it works like a sandbox where the only limit for the player is their own imagination and creativity.</p>

       <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>The game takes place in the fictional city of Port Carverton, which embraces skateboarding, unlike the "skaters are not criminals" mentality present in the second game.

   <li><h2>Hades</h2></li>
     <img src="../assets/images/hades.png" alt="hades banner" height="415">
       <h3>Synopsis</h3>
